There are three main CAD files: 
-Switch Box
-Remote Control Casing
-Fan and Sensor Stand.

All three of these use bounding box CADs of the electrical components that are in the Electonic Models folder.

The three main files have STL and STEP options.
The STL have split the lids and hulls of the casings while the STEP contains them together.

The STL version can be used to print without any checking, 
but it may be useful to slice the casings in half and print them in two parts. 
This has already been done in the Switch Casing CAD to prevent a large amount of support structures and allow for faster print times.
Therefore, the STEP file is given for any adjustments that may need to be done.
