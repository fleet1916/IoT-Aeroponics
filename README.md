# IoT-Aeroponics
An basic IoT solution for aeroponics system control based on Arduino 
This project uses a ESP 8266 to set up WiFi and server to allow the control of multiple aeroponics systems to raise multiple plants. 
The Main Control Terminal sends out input command through a WiFi server.
The bucket control station controls 5 bucket. It can operate time control mode, percentage control mode and on/off mode.
